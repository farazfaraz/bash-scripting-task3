# My Project
#### Write a script to serve an HTTP server using bash and create two endpoints for the index page and health check.
# use the project
* Download HTTPserver.sh
* Transform the project into an executable project : chmod +x BachupToStorage.sh
* run the program (./HTTPserver.sh) on your terminal.
* Open another terminal and run the following commands:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/index
```
```
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
* Or run one of them without curl on your browser.
* if you send an address that contains neither index nor health it tells you that the page does not exist.
